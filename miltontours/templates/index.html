                                        <p class="card-text text-truncate text-dark">Every year, new models of motorcycles come from manufacturers all around the world (and others are discontinued). Some are evolutions of previous models, others are completely new, introducing us to the latest and greatest that each company can make. This year, we have had the fortune of no less than 60 new models already announced, with many in showrooms and available to buy as you read this!

                                            With so many two-wheeled steeds waiting, tempting us to swing a leg over and crank the right wrist, it can be overwhelming in trying to narrow your choices down. Regardless of brand, style, riding type, having that much choice in a single model year is daunting.

                                            It is for this reason that we have put together a list of what we believe are the 10 best new motorcycles for this year, in no particular order. Keep in mind, with over 60 new models to choose from, it took us a while to make our own picks, so this is not a be-all, end-all list.</p>

Considering the appropriate learning curve of a new rider, we say that getting a motorcycle is probably around step 3, after step 1, taking a training course, and step 2, getting all your personal protective equipment. But, you may be asking, what motorcycle should I get?

                                            This is one of the most asked questions in the world of new riders, by a large margin. The short answer is "Whatever you want," but that leaves out a few very important factors that a new rider should be aware of. A supersport is not a great first bike. A 1,700 cc v-twin muscle cruiser is not a friendly bike to learn on. Even a 900cc motorcycle can be bad to learn on, especially if it’s meant to be a dual-sport adventure bike.

                                            It is for this reason that we have put together a list of the 10 best motorcycles for beginners, broken down by category. All of the bikes listed below are perfect places to start your motorcycling career, with friendly handling characteristics, approachable power, and forgiving frames and suspension so you can learn the ins and outs of daily riding!</p>

                                        <p class="card-text text-truncate text-dark">Touring motorcycles are a special breed. They need to be strong and reliable, and able to accelerate to highway speeds whilst carrying heavy luggage or riding two-up, but they also need to be comfortable and equipped with plenty of accessories to keep riders relaxed for mile after mile. Today, there are more touring motorcycles available than before, each geared towards different riders with different touring ambitions.

                                            For this list, we’re looking at the 10 best touring motorcycles for 2023, and by “touring” we mean it in the traditional sense of the word. While you can tour on any motorcycle, we’re not including adventure touring motorcycles or sports touring motorcycles. That’s not strictly true, since one slipped through the net, but it’ll make sense when you get to it.

                                            So, let’s take a look at the best touring motorcycles out there that you can go out and buy in 2023.</p>
